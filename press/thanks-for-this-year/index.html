    <h1 class="press-release-title">This was #gbgtechweek 2017, thank you all!</h1>

    <p class="press-release-intro">26 events, more than 25 organisations that collaborated, around 2 000 visitors, and a lot of inspiration. #gbgtechweek took place between 1-7th of May 2017, and was bigger and better than ever. A broad spectrum of events and a lot of visitors who never attended a tech or startup event before.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info"><i>“We do not only want to measure the total amount of visitors, the most important metric for us is that we attract new people to the tech and startup scene. Otherwise we just pray for the choir.”</i> - Andreas Rolén, Organiser of #gbgtechweek</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">The crew behind #gbgtechweek are satisfied with the results of this year’s week, and plan to make it both bigger and better next year. The dates for next year’s week will be released soon on the website <a href="https://www.gbgtechweek.com">www.gbgtechweek.com</a>.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">Here are some images that summarize the week.</p>
