    <h1 class="press-release-title">Thanks for #gbgtechweek 2018!</h1>

    <p class="press-release-intro">#gbgtechweek 2018 turned out great. More than thirty events made this year’s gbgtechweek the largest one so far. Together with great organisations that created and hosted events all over Gothenburg, great events turned out amazing.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info"><i>“We are really seeing how this week grow for every year we organise it. Reaching more than 100 hours of events during one week wasn't even something we dreamt of when we started this”</i>, says Andreas Rolén, Organiser of #gbgtechweek</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">Between the 21st and 25th of May this year over thirty events all around Gothenburg within tech and startup were organised in order to bring the community together, but also to put some extra light on the tech and startup scene of Gothenburg. The organisers, #gbgtechweek, put a lot of effort into getting a diverse portfolio of events in order for both the most tech savvy developers to the most business minded entrepreneurs to feel welcome.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info"><i>“Without relevant content where the event attendees feel that they can develop themselves and learn new things the week is useless. Therefore we focus on making sure that we have relevant content, both by covering different verticals, but also by covering the different depths of the verticals”</i> - Linus Olsson, organiser of #gbgtechweek.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">During the week organisers like GU Ventures, Chalmers Ventures, Findwise, Business Region Göteborg, Breakit, Ericsson, Drivhuset, and a lot of other organisers collaborated to organise all the different events. At “Entrepreneurship & Value Creation in Life Science” hosted by GU Ventures and Sahlgrenska Science Park the guests got to hear how the area is developing, what the latest trends, and how Gothenburg can support businesses within this area.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">One of the most interesting events according to Andreas Rolén, one of the organisers of #gbgtechweek, was “How to realign technology with humanity” by the digital agency Varvet. At this event Píerre Reimerts, Lisa Hammarström, and Jonas Nicklas talked on three different angles on how technology needs to be aligned with the humanity to be sustainable.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info"><i>“I’ve visited many tech and startup event, but this one was different! High profile developers and designers talking on the topic of tech, but with another approach: How products we build affect us, the people around us, and the environment in general. I was completely stunned by the talks!”</i>, says Andreas.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">The week would never be possible without the different partners of #gbgtechweek. Last year The Trade & Industry Group of Gothenburg&Co joined. This year they continued to support the week, and Region Västra Götaland and Volvo Cars also joined in.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info"><i>“Without our partners we would never be able to organise #gbgtechweek to this big extent. They make the work for us that organise this on our free time without any pay so much easier. Also, being backed up by both Gothenburg&Co and Region Västra Götaland is a sign that what we do actually is important for the city of Gothenburg.”</i> says Malin Kjällström, who’s been in the organising group for three years.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">#gbgtechweek will be back in 2019, bigger and better than ever. Stay tuned on https://gbgtechweek.com/ for more information. If you are interested in organising an event during #gbgtechweek 2019 you can get more information on the website as well.</p>
