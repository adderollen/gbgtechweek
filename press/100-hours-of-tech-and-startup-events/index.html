    <p class="press-release-img-text">This year #gbgtechweek will contain more than 100 hours of tech and startup events</p>
    <h1 class="press-release-title">100+ hours of tech and startup events during #gbgtechweek</h1>

    <p class="press-release-intro">For the fourth year #gbgtechweek is back, bigger and better than ever. During next week, people in Gothenburg will be able to indulge in 100+ hours of tech and startup events during #gbgtechweek.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info"><i>“We are really seeing how this week grow for every year we organise it. Reaching more than 100 hours of events during one week wasn't even something we dreamt of when we started this”</i>, says Andreas Rolén, Organiser of #gbgtechweek</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">Once again #gbgtechweek manage to attract some of the most inspiring speakers to the week. One of the most experienced is Gustaf Alströmer, previously Head of Growth at Airbnb and now Partner at Y Combinator. Several of Gothenburg's most famous startup and tech people such as Patrik Arnesson - CEO and Co-founder at Forza Football, Marie Brattberg - VP Product Design at Recorded Future, Tomas Ohlson - Autonomous Drive Specialist at Einride, and Gabriel Kamienny - Co-founder of Adfenix.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info">The week is filled with 25 events all over Gothenburg and are of course free of charge. The organisers put a lot of effort in making sure that there are events both for the new, but also for the experienced entreprenuer. They also put a lot of focus on not only covering the typical business and investment event, but also bring more tech-savy events to the week.</p>

    <p class="press-release-info"><i>"We've seen that a lot of cities around in Europe stopped focus on the tech events, and only on the business events. In Stockholm people are talking about moving to Malmö, since they feel excluded from the tech and startup scene due to that all events and communities only focus on money and the business. We believe that we need to cover both areas, and the mixture of them"</i>, Andreas continues.</p>
