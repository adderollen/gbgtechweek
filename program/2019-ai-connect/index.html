        <h4>Personal privacy vs. public security : Panel Discussion</h4>

        <p>Across the world, We can see clear developments with more data and increasingly advanced ways of analyzing these data patterns. But unfortunately, we can only set the limits for what can be monitored just by our imagination and further creating laws (not by technology). Today there are camera systems that can follow the slightest movement and even analyze behaviors. But also the data we ourselves leave behind on social media or other places on the net can be analyzed in a way that has not been possible before. How will this change our view of personal privacy? Where is the limit for what we are prepared to accept for a safer society?</p>

        <p>You all are cordially invited for this very interesting panel discussion, moderated by Fredrik Hofflander, Head of Connected Solutions (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)</p>

        <h4>Rise of conversational AI chatbots : Short Seminar</h4>

        <p>A recent study suggests that consumer buying pattern is changing. People now prefer to interact with the business in real time while making their purchases over any other medium of communication. In order to dive more and more consumer interaction, it is becoming increasingly important for every sector to initiate real-time conversations with the help of AI.</p>

        <p>With the help of technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, real-time conversations between conversational AI chatbots and consumers can increase to a great extent. Earlier, a human had to be constantly present for carrying out real-time communications with customers. The best thing about this technology is that the interaction gets better as users use the bot.</p>

        <p>Consumers like information to be made available to them quickly at the tap of a button or in a single click. They can easily turn to competitors when they are frustrated due to the unavailability of information quickly. If the competitors provide users the experience they are looking for, it can negatively impact your business. The most common complaints include an inability to navigate through the website, not finding information regarding the business details, phone number, hours of operation, etc. Another factor that drives away users is when they can’t find solutions to simple queries.</p>

        <p>If you want to learn more about chatbots, then you are very welcome to join us. Prajit Datta, AI Research Scientist from ÅF Pöyry will host this seminar to take you through the developmental journey of conversational AI.</p>

        <h4>Will AI take my job? : Panel Discussion</h4>

        <p>About 35% of all current jobs are at high risk of computerisation over the following 20 years, according to a study by researchers at Oxford University and Deloitte. Jobs have, as long as mankind been around, always been replaced by tools, machines and automation. This has always been in a speed that we have been able to manage. So why are so many people worried now? Is AI just a hype or will AI replace us all?</p>

        <p>You all are cordially invited for this very interesting panel discussion, moderated by Fredrik Hofflander, Head of Connected Solutions (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)</p>

        <p>Will food be served? Yes, refreshments are waiting for you.</p>
