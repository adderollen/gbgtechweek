        <p>During the Dragons’ Den, 6 start-ups will pitch their ideas to 5 prominent investors. Companies and investors alike will compete for a price purse worth 50 000 SEK for most attractive investor and most promising start-up.</p>

        <p>A panel of 5 successful investors will jointly judge the investability of 6 tech start-ups. The assessment criteria will be the same as in the popular tv-show ‘Dragons’ Den’, i.e. each individual investor will ask questions and then decide whether or not they are interested in a continued investment discussion or not. The company that catches the interest of most investors wins a price purse worth 50 000 SEK.</p>

        <p>Start-ups interested in pitching are requested to apply to gbgtechweek by filling out a pitch template. Gbgtechweek will, together with Gothenburg-based angel investor network, IDA, and financing firm, Avanoa AB, select the six start-ups allowed to pitch for the Dragons’ Den panel.</p>

        <p>In parallel with the pitching competition, the audience will be asked to select the most apt and relevant Dragon. The winning investor will receive an investor-tailored price purse.</p>
